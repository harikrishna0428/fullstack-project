## Troubleshooting

### Python not found?
- Install Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Make sure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation

### Port already in use?
- Change port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`

### Dependencies fail to install?
- Upgrade pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Try again: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Flask debug mode error (watchdog)?
- Upgrade watchdog: `pip install --upgrade watchdog`
- This fixes the `EVENT_TYPE_OPENED` import error

### PowerShell script execution disabled?
- Use Git Bash: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
- Or enable scripts: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
